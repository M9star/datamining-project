Project Title: Analysis of Sample Dataset using Classification 

Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of a sample dataset using classification techniques and the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process. The primary objective is to explore and understand the dataset through various stages of data processing, classification, and clustering.

Key Steps
1. Data Selection
A dataset with 100 instances and 12 attributes was chosen from a pool of over 1300 datasets.
2. Data Cleaning
The dataset underwent cleaning processes, including the removal of duplicates and handling of null values.
3. Coding
Attributes with yes/no values were coded to 1/0 for relevant features like health check, animals, and child death.
4. Data Mining
Various algorithms and techniques were applied for mining patterns and insights from the dataset.
5. Reporting
Results from the learning algorithms were documented and analyzed.

Decision from the Output
The project compared Random Forest and Na√Øve Bayes for classification, determining Random Forest as the superior algorithm based on multiple performance metrics.
Hierarchical clustering outperformed k-means, achieving higher accuracy, particularly in class 1 (no child death).

Conclusion
The project concludes by summarizing the key findings, emphasizing the preprocessing steps applied to the dataset, and highlighting the chosen classification and clustering algorithms. T
